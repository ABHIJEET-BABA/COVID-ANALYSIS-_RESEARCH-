The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was widely reported to have first been detected in Wuhan (Hebei province, China) in December 2019. After the initial outbreak, COVID-19 continued to spread to all provinces in China and very quickly spread to other countries within and outside of Asia. At present, over 45 million cases of infected individuals have been confirmed in over 180 countries with in excess of 1 million deaths [1]. Although the foundations of this disease are very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus that took hold of Asia in 2003, it is shown to spread much more easily and there currently exists no vaccine.
